<p>You don't seem very frightening this time, John. You don't seem poisoned. How? When you're finished dying,
            maybe you can somehow dispose off this serial cake. They were numbers... Written on her phone... Why did
            they die here? Honestly holding this flat for 28 days is not a good taste. </p>
          <p>Sherlock is hired by an old friend to investigate a mysterious break-in at a bank in the city. He has an
            intense rivalry with a woman he once believed to have been one of the victims of a robbery. As he looks
            forward to the next chapter of the novel, he also discovers that it will be difficult for a thief to come
            forward with the details of the crimes and the location of the theft, which was discovered in the last scene
            in the novel's cover art. In his role as one of the villain in the crime series, Sherlock Holmes has become
            a target of both the detectives and the criminals. He also works as an informant for the FBI and is the lead
            investigator in the crime series as the detective in the movie The Man Who Stole the Bank.</p>
