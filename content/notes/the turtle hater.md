<p>sherlock holmes had no idea where he'd slept the last night. It felt like he was dead. The only way to go about it was to sleep in a motel full of fluffy kittens that were weird to look at.</p>

<p>"You're so cute, huh? That's what you're supposed to be. You're your only girl, right?" he whispered. he had no idea what that meant but he was sure he was in the right here. the kittens hated the leftists or whatever was left of them. His mind was still trying to find its own way out. in his mind, it was the noblest thing one could do when strapped to a rocket full of pigeons wanting to scream "coo" every time the wind made a sound they couldn't hear.</p>

<p>"The way you do it, I'm afraid, are so different from the way you think?" he said as he gulped down a gallon of mace that was dripping from the table that was now in the same room as him. "i hate the turtles and i want them to know that." he continued. this was going to be a long day, sherlock knew, because the faster you are the slower the turtles feel in comparison. "I mean, how many times have you told me that you're going to birth a turtle egg?" he asked, taking his seat. He looked at him as he looked up.</p>

<p>eggs are born the day turtles die. 34 sherlocks said in unison.</p>
